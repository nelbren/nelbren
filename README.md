# Hi there 👋

# Welcome to my github profile! 🥳

- ## I'm a Fullstack web developer from **Honduras**: 
  - ### **Honduras** is in the center of the world, more specifically in **Central America** 👉 🌎. 
  - ### You may have heard of the Bay Islands, you will find that Roatan is considered to be the second largest reef in the world 🤿.
  - ### Another 💎 jewel is Copan Ruins, which is an archaeological site of the ancient Mayan civilization.
- ## Now coming back to me, I tell you that:
  - ## I like 🕹 video games and 🎧 music.
  - ## I am passionate about ❤️ **open source** and 📖 **learning / teaching**.
  - ## And therefore everything that has to do with 💻 technology.

- ## Some of the coolest projects I work on every day, using my mantra, what I recommend is because I use it:
  - **[miner_preview](https://github.com/nelbren/miner_preview)** - Get 💰 wallet 📈 balance from 💻[Ethermine](https://www.ethermine.org/) and ☁️[Cloudatcost](https://www.cloudatcost.com/) ⛏️ mining 🚧 process.
  - **[yafp](https://github.com/nelbren/yafp)** - Is a project to facilitate the customization of the prompt, with the status of the repository and python environment.
  - **[enable](https://github.com/nelbren/npres/tree/master/bin/enable)** - It is a project to make **things easier**, **sudo**, the **above**, and **color** the terminal, so that the **fun** does **not die**.
- ## ⚡ **These are my 🤘🏼 boy scout 🎖 medals humbly assigned by me 😊:**
